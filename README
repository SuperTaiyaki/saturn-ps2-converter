Code to build a converter that takes a Sega Saturn controller on one end and plugs into a Playstation 1 or 2 on the
other.

The code is written to build with avra. The 'writenew' script has the fuse settings. sat2ps2.html is an old document
that shows the pinout and has some other details.

Revision history is messing because it was originally in darcs and isn't worth the trouble to convert.
